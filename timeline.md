# ARPABET
ARPABET (also spelled ARPAbet) is a set of phonetic transcription codes developed by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) as a part of their Speech Understanding Research project in the 1970s. 
It represents `phonemes` and `allophones` of General American English with distinct sequences of ASCII characters. 
ARPABET has been used in several speech synthesizers, including Computalker for the S-100 system, SAM for the Commodore 64, SAY for the Amiga, TextAssist for the PC and Speakeasy from Intelligent Artefacts which used the Votrax SC-01 speech synthesiser IC. It is also used in the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. 
A revised version of ARPABET is used in the [TIMIT](#TIMIT) corpus.


# Datasets
* [TIMIT] (TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus)
TIMIT is a corpus of phonemically and lexically transcribed speech of American English speakers of different sexes and dialects.
The TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus is a standard dataset used for evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems. 
The TIMIT telephone corpus was an early attempt to create a database with speech samples.
Each transcribed element has been delineated in time. TIMIT was designed to further acoustic-phonetic knowledge and automatic speech recognition systems.
TIMIT was designed to further acoustic-phonetic knowledge and automatic speech recognition systems. It was commissioned by DARPA and corpus design was a joint effort between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SRI International, and Texas Instruments (TI).
